# splitpage
This is implemented using HTML, CSS and basic Javascript.

## Motivation
Learning Javascript from **Traversy** youtube videos inpired me to building along in the **50 Days 50 Projects**, this was one of the projects worked on during the course of the challenge.


## General Information
This project includes a step by step guide on how to make a split animation using Javascript, in this project the page is splitted into two equal parts on the screen, and when hovered on the any side of the screen it takes 70% size of the screen and the other side takes 30%.


## Technologies
